Vyper is a **risk management** protocol, enabling users to buy and sell risk based on their preferences.

Vyper's innovative approach to risk management relies on an established TradFi concept called tranching. Vyper brings tranching to DeFi, unlocking its full potential and transforming the way users interact with DeFi protocols.

## What is tranching?

Tranching is a risk sharing mechanism which allows the repackaging of yield-generating assets to distribute returns according to different risk profiles.
To make a simple example: Alice and Bob both deposit $50 to a lending protocol. Alice gives up part of the interest generated but Bobâ€™s capital is impacted first if any hack/default happens.
We would refer to Alice as having a senior tranche (**less risk**, less yield) and to Bob as having a junior tranche (more risk, **more yield**).
This simple but effective concept powers a $10tn+ market in TradFi.

## The Protocol

Vyper manages the creation and redemption of tranches and deployment of locked funds. By integrating with new and existing protocols, Vyper enables the possibility of creating innovative products and entire ecosystems.
Vyper is unique in bringing tranching to DeFi while at the same time taking a modular approach, enabling **composability**.
