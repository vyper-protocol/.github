Vyper is a **risk management** protocol, enabling users to buy and sell risk based on their preferences.

Vyper's innovative approach to risk management relies on an established TradFi concept called tranching. Vyper brings tranching to DeFi, unlocking its full potential and transforming the way users interact with DeFi protocols.
